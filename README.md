## What is WKuWKu ?

WkuWku aims to transform your existing Android devices into a multi-platform retro gaming console, allowing you to enjoy classic retro games anytime, anywhere—much like [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch). However, unlike RetroArch, its goal is not only to run various [libretro](https://www.libretro.com/index.php/api/) cores, but also to support other systems — such as running Flash content through [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle). In short, it is a libretro frontend, but also more than just a libretro frontend.

## What's goal?

I think, WkuWku should be:

- Feature-rich and stable

- Simple yet aesthetically pleasing in design

- Easy to operate

- Lightweight

- iOS support? (Perhaps)

> Update frequency is weekly

## What is the current status?

The project is currently in **development**, with many features not yet finalized or requiring testing. If you’re interested in the application, feel free to visit the release page to download and try it out.
